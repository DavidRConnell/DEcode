## Welcome to DEcode!

The goal of this project is to enable you to utilize genomic big data in identifying regulatory mechanisms for differential expression (DE).

DEcode predicts inter-tissue variations and inter-person variations in gene expression levels from [TF-promoter interactions](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1128), [RNABP-mRNA interactions](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky830), and [miRNA-mRNA interactions](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05005). You can read more about this method in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.10.894238) where we conducted a series of evaluation and applications by predicting transcript usage, drivers of aging DE, gene coexpression relationships on a genome-wide scale, and frequent DE in diverse conditions.

### Quick start

This tutorial shows you a way to run DEcode on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) that provides you free access to a ready-to-use machine learning environment with a high-end GPU.

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and sign in to your Google account.
2. Open Jupyter notebook.
    - Menu -> File -> Open notebook -> GITHUB tab
    - Search `https://github.com/stasaki/DEcode`
    - Select `Run_DEcode.ipynb`
3. Run each block of code.
