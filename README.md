## Welcome to DEcode!

The goal of this project is to enable you to utilize genomic big data in identifying regulatory mechanisms for any human expression data.

### Quick start

This tutorial shows you a way to run DEcode on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) that provides you free access to a ready-to-use machine learning environment with a high-end GPU.

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and sign in to your Google account.
2. Open Jupyter notebook.
    - Menu -> File -> Open notebook -> GITHUB tab
    - Search `https://github.com/stasaki/DEcode`
    - Select `Run_DEcode.ipynb`
3. Run each block of code.
